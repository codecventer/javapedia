# HashMap

## Basic Usage

**Let’s first look at what it means that _HashMap_ is a map. A map is a key-value mapping, which means that every key is mapped to exactly one value and that we can use the key to retrieve the corresponding value from a map.**

One might ask why not simply add the value to a list. Why do we need a _HashMap_? The simple reason is performance. If we want to find a specific element in a list, the time complexity is _O(n)_ and if the list is sorted, it will be _O(log n)_ using, for example, a binary search.

The advantage of a _HashMap_ is that the time complexity to insert and retrieve a value is _O(1)_ on average. We’ll look at how that can be achieved later. Let’s first look at how to use _HashMap_.

### Setup

Let’s create a simple class that we’ll use throughout the article:

```java filename="hash_map_setup.java"
public class Product {

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private List<String> tags;

    // standard getters/setters/constructors

    public Product addTagsOfOtherProduct(Product product) {
        this.tags.addAll(product.getTags());
        return this;
    }
}
```

### Put

We can now create a _HashMap_ with the key of type _String_ and elements of type _Product_:

```java filename="hashmap_put.java"
Map<String, Product> productsByName = new HashMap<>();
```

And add products to our _HashMap_:

```java filename="hashmap_put_1.java"
Product eBike = new Product("E-Bike", "A bike with a battery");
Product roadBike = new Product("Road bike", "A bike for competition");
productsByName.put(eBike.getName(), eBike);
productsByName.put(roadBike.getName(), roadBike);
```

### Get

We can retrieve a value from the map by its key:

```java filename="hash_map_get.java"
Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get("E-Bike");
assertEquals("A bike with a battery", nextPurchase.getDescription());
```

If we try to find a value for a key that doesn’t exist in the map, we’ll get a _null_ value:

```java filename="hash_map_get_1.java"
Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get("Car");
assertNull(nextPurchase);
```

And if we insert a second value with the same key, we’ll only get the last inserted value for that key:

```java filename="hash_map_get_2.java"
Product newEBike = new Product("E-Bike", "A bike with a better battery");
productsByName.put(newEBike.getName(), newEBike);
assertEquals("A bike with a better battery", productsByName.get("E-Bike").getDescription());
```

### Null as the key

_HashMap_ also allows us to have _null_ as a key:

```java filename="hash_map_null_key.java"
Product defaultProduct = new Product("Chocolate", "At least buy chocolate");
productsByName.put(null, defaultProduct);

Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get(null);
assertEquals("At least buy chocolate", nextPurchase.getDescription());
```

### Values with Same Key

Furthermore, we can insert the same object twice with a different key:

```java filename="hash_map_same_key_value.java"
productsByName.put(defaultProduct.getName(), defaultProduct);
assertSame(productsByName.get(null), productsByName.get("Chocolate"));
```

### Remove Value

We can remove a key-value mapping from the _HashMap_:

```java filename="hash_map_remove.java"
productsByName.remove("E-Bike");
assertNull(productsByName.get("E-Bike"));
```

### Check if Key or Value Exists

To check if a key is present in the map, we can use the _containsKey()_ method:

```java filename="hash_map_check_exists.java"
productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike");
```

Or, to check if a value is present in the map, we can use the _containsValue()_ method:

```java filename="hash_map_check_exists_1.java"
productsByName.containsValue(eBike);
```

Both method calls will return _true_ in our example. Though they look very similar, there is an important difference in performance between these two method calls. **The complexity to check if a key exists is _O(1)_, while the complexity to check for an element is _O(n)_, as it’s necessary to loop over all the elements in the map**.

### Iterating Over _HashMap_

There are three basic ways to iterate over all key-value pairs in a _HashMap_.

We can iterate over the set of all keys:

```java filename="hash_map_iterator.java"
for(String key : productsByName.keySet()) {
    Product product = productsByName.get(key);
}
```

Or we can iterate over the set of all entries:

```java filename="hash_map_iterator_1.java"
for(Map.Entry<String, Product> entry : productsByName.entrySet()) {
    Product product =  entry.getValue();
    String key = entry.getKey();
    //do something with the key and value
}
```

Fiinally, we can iterate over all values:

```java filename="hash_map_iterator_2.java"
List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>(productsByName.values());
```

## The Key

**We can use any class as the key in our _HashMap_. However, for the map to work properly, we need to provide an implementation for _equals()_ and _hashCode()_**. Let’s say we want to have a map with the product as the key and the price as the value:

```java filename="hash_map_key.java"
HashMap<Product, Integer> priceByProduct = new HashMap<>();
priceByProduct.put(eBike, 900);
```

Let’s implement the _equals()_ and _hashCode()_ methods:

```java filename="hash_map_key_1.java"
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) {
        return true;
    }
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) {
        return false;
    }

    Product product = (Product) o;
    return Objects.equals(name, product.name) &&
      Objects.equals(description, product.description);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, description);
}
```

**Note that _hashCode()_ and _equals()_ need to be overridden only for classes that we want to use as map keys, not for classes that are only used as values in a map**. We’ll see why this is necessary in section 5 of this article.

## Additional Methods as of Java 8

Java 8 added several functional-style methods to _HashMap_. In this section, we’ll look at some of these methods.

**For each method, we’ll look at two examples**. The first example shows how to use the new method, and the second example shows how to achieve the same in earlier versions of Java.

As these methods are quite straightforward, we won’t look at more detailed examples.

### _forEach()_

The _forEach_ method is the functional-style way to iterate over all elements in the map:

```java filename="hash_map_for_each.java"
productsByName.forEach( (key, product) -> {
    System.out.println("Key: " + key + " Product:" + product.getDescription());
    //do something with the key and value
});
```

Prior to Java 8:

```java filename="hash_map_for_each_1.java"
for(Map.Entry<String, Product> entry : productsByName.entrySet()) {
    Product product =  entry.getValue();
    String key = entry.getKey();
    //do something with the key and value
}
```

### _getOrDefault()_
