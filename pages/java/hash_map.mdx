# HashMap

## Basic Usage

**Let’s first look at what it means that _HashMap_ is a map. A map is a key-value mapping, which means that every key is mapped to exactly one value and that we can use the key to retrieve the corresponding value from a map.**

One might ask why not simply add the value to a list. Why do we need a _HashMap_? The simple reason is performance. If we want to find a specific element in a list, the time complexity is _O(n)_ and if the list is sorted, it will be _O(log n)_ using, for example, a binary search.

The advantage of a _HashMap_ is that the time complexity to insert and retrieve a value is _O(1)_ on average. We’ll look at how that can be achieved later. Let’s first look at how to use _HashMap_.

### Setup

Let’s create a simple class that we’ll use throughout the article:

```java
public class Product {

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private List<String> tags;

    // standard getters/setters/constructors

    public Product addTagsOfOtherProduct(Product product) {
        this.tags.addAll(product.getTags());
        return this;
    }
}
```

### Put

We can now create a _HashMap_ with the key of type _String_ and elements of type _Product_:

```java
Map<String, Product> productsByName = new HashMap<>();
```

And add products to our _HashMap_:

```java
Product eBike = new Product("E-Bike", "A bike with a battery");
Product roadBike = new Product("Road bike", "A bike for competition");
productsByName.put(eBike.getName(), eBike);
productsByName.put(roadBike.getName(), roadBike);
```

### Get

We can retrieve a value from the map by its key:

```java
Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get("E-Bike");
assertEquals("A bike with a battery", nextPurchase.getDescription());
```

If we try to find a value for a key that doesn’t exist in the map, we’ll get a _null_ value:

```java
Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get("Car");
assertNull(nextPurchase);
```

And if we insert a second value with the same key, we’ll only get the last inserted value for that key:

```java
Product newEBike = new Product("E-Bike", "A bike with a better battery");
productsByName.put(newEBike.getName(), newEBike);
assertEquals("A bike with a better battery", productsByName.get("E-Bike").getDescription());
```

### Null as the key

_HashMap_ also allows us to have _null_ as a key:

```java
Product defaultProduct = new Product("Chocolate", "At least buy chocolate");
productsByName.put(null, defaultProduct);

Product nextPurchase = productsByName.get(null);
assertEquals("At least buy chocolate", nextPurchase.getDescription());
```

### Values with Same Key

Furthermore, we can insert the same object twice with a different key:

```java
productsByName.put(defaultProduct.getName(), defaultProduct);
assertSame(productsByName.get(null), productsByName.get("Chocolate"));
```

### Remove Value

We can remove a key-value mapping from the _HashMap_:

```java
productsByName.remove("E-Bike");
assertNull(productsByName.get("E-Bike"));
```

### Check if Key or Value Exists

To check if a key is present in the map, we can use the _containsKey()_ method:

```java
productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike");
```

Or, to check if a value is present in the map, we can use the _containsValue()_ method:

```java
productsByName.containsValue(eBike);
```

Both method calls will return _true_ in our example. Though they look very similar, there is an important difference in performance between these two method calls. **The complexity to check if a key exists is _O(1)_, while the complexity to check for an element is _O(n)_, as it’s necessary to loop over all the elements in the map**.

### Iterating Over _HashMap_

There are three basic ways to iterate over all key-value pairs in a _HashMap_.

We can iterate over the set of all keys:

```java
for(String key : productsByName.keySet()) {
    Product product = productsByName.get(key);
}
```

Or we can iterate over the set of all entries:

```java
for(Map.Entry<String, Product> entry : productsByName.entrySet()) {
    Product product =  entry.getValue();
    String key = entry.getKey();
    //do something with the key and value
}
```

Fiinally, we can iterate over all values:

```java
List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>(productsByName.values());
```

## The Key

**We can use any class as the key in our _HashMap_. However, for the map to work properly, we need to provide an implementation for _equals()_ and _hashCode()_**. Let’s say we want to have a map with the product as the key and the price as the value:

```java
HashMap<Product, Integer> priceByProduct = new HashMap<>();
priceByProduct.put(eBike, 900);
```

Let’s implement the _equals()_ and _hashCode()_ methods:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) {
        return true;
    }
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) {
        return false;
    }

    Product product = (Product) o;
    return Objects.equals(name, product.name) &&
      Objects.equals(description, product.description);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, description);
}
```

**Note that _hashCode()_ and _equals()_ need to be overridden only for classes that we want to use as map keys, not for classes that are only used as values in a map**. We’ll see why this is necessary in section 5 of this article.

## Additional Methods as of Java 8

Java 8 added several functional-style methods to _HashMap_. In this section, we’ll look at some of these methods.

**For each method, we’ll look at two examples**. The first example shows how to use the new method, and the second example shows how to achieve the same in earlier versions of Java.

As these methods are quite straightforward, we won’t look at more detailed examples.

### _forEach()_

The _forEach_ method is the functional-style way to iterate over all elements in the map:

```java
productsByName.forEach( (key, product) -> {
    System.out.println("Key: " + key + " Product:" + product.getDescription());
    //do something with the key and value
});
```

Prior to Java 8:

```java
for(Map.Entry<String, Product> entry : productsByName.entrySet()) {
    Product product =  entry.getValue();
    String key = entry.getKey();
    //do something with the key and value
}
```

### _getOrDefault()_

Using the _getOrDefault()_ method, we can get a value from the map or return a default element in case there is no mapping for the given key:

```java
Product chocolate = new Product("chocolate", "something sweet");
Product defaultProduct = productsByName.getOrDefault("horse carriage", chocolate);
Product bike = productsByName.getOrDefault("E-Bike", chocolate);
```

Prior to Java 8:

```java
Product bike2 = productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike")
    ? productsByName.get("E-Bike")
    : chocolate;
Product defaultProduct2 = productsByName.containsKey("horse carriage")
    ? productsByName.get("horse carriage")
    : chocolate;
```

### _putIfAbsent()_

With this method, we can add a new mapping, but only if there is not yet a mapping for the given key:

```java
productsByName.putIfAbsent("E-Bike", chocolate);
```

Prior to Java 8:

```java
if(!productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike")) {
    productsByName.put("E-Bike", chocolate);
}
```

### _merge()_

And with _merge()_, we can modify the value for a given key if a mapping exists, or add a new value otherwise:

```java
Product eBike2 = new Product("E-Bike", "A bike with a battery");
eBike2.getTags().add("sport");
productsByName.merge("E-Bike", eBike2, Product::addTagsOfOtherProduct);
```

Prior to Java 8:

```java
if(productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike")) {
    productsByName.get("E-Bike").addTagsOfOtherProduct(eBike2);
} else {
    productsByName.put("E-Bike", eBike2);
}
```

### _compute()_

With the _compute()_ method, we can compute the value for a given key:

```java
productsByName.compute("E-Bike", (k,v) -> {
    if(v != null) {
        return v.addTagsOfOtherProduct(eBike2);
    } else {
        return eBike2;
    }
});
```

Prior to Java 8

```java
if(productsByName.containsKey("E-Bike")) {
    productsByName.get("E-Bike").addTagsOfOtherProduct(eBike2);
} else {
    productsByName.put("E-Bike", eBike2);
}
```

It’s worth noting that the **methods _merge()_ and _compute()_ are quite similar**. The _compute()_ method accepts two arguments: the _key_ and a _BiFunction_ for the remapping. And _merge()_ accepts three parameters: the _key_, a _default value_ to add to the map if the key doesn’t exist yet, and a _BiFunction_ for the remapping.

## _HashMap_ Internals

In this section, we’ll look at how _HashMap_ works internally and what are the benefits of using _HashMap_ instead of a simple list, for example.

As we’ve seen, we can retrieve an element from a _HashMap_ by its key. One approach would be to use a list, iterate over all elements, and return when we find an element for which the key matches. Both the time and space complexity of this approach would be _O(n)_.

**With _HashMap_, we can achieve an average time complexity of _O(1)_ for the _put_ and _get_ operations and space complexity of _O(n)_**. Let’s see how that works.

### The Hash Code and Equals

**Instead of iterating over all its elements, _HashMap_ attempts to calculate the position of a value based on its key.**

The naive approach would be to have a list that can contain as many elements as there are keys possible. As an example, let’s say our key is a lower-case character. Then it’s sufficient to have a list of size 26, and if we want to access the element with key ‘c’, we’d know that it’s the one at position 3, and we can retrieve it directly.

However, this approach would not be very effective if we have a much bigger keyspace. For example, let’s say our key was an integer. In this case, the size of the list would have to be 2,147,483,647. In most cases, we would also have far fewer elements, so a big part of the allocated memory would remain unused.

**_HashMap_ stores elements in so-called buckets and the number of buckets is called _capacity_**.

When we put a value in the map, the key’s _hashCode()_ method is used to determine the bucket in which the value will be stored.

To retrieve the value, _HashMap_ calculates the bucket in the same way – using _hashCode()_. Then it iterates through the objects found in that bucket and use key’s _equals()_ method to find the exact match.

### Keys’ Immutability

***In most cases, we should use immutable keys. Or at least, we must be aware of the consequences of using mutable keys***.

Let’s see what happens when our key changes after we used it to store a value in a map.

For this example, we’ll create the _MutableKey_:

```java
public class MutableKey {
    private String name;

    // standard constructor, getter and setter

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) {
            return true;
        }
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        MutableKey that = (MutableKey) o;
        return Objects.equals(name, that.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name);
    }
}
```

And here goes the test:

```java
MutableKey key = new MutableKey("initial");

Map<MutableKey, String> items = new HashMap<>();
items.put(key, "success");

key.setName("changed");

assertNull(items.get(key));
```

As we can see, we’re no longer able to get the corresponding value once the key has changed, instead, _null_ is returned. **This is because _HashMap_ is searching in the wrong bucket**.

The above test case may be surprising if we don’t have a good understanding of how _HashMap_ works internally.

### Capacity and Load Factor

To avoid having many buckets with multiple values, the capacity is doubled if 75% (the load factor) of the buckets become non-empty. The default value for the load factor is 75%, and the default initial capacity is 16. Both can be set in the constructor.

### Summary of _put_ and _get_ Operations

Let’s summarize how the _put_ and _get_ operations work.

**When we add an element to the map**, _HashMap_ calculates the bucket. If the bucket already contains a value, the value is added to the list (or tree) belonging to that bucket. If the load factor becomes bigger than the maximum load factor of the map, the capacity is doubled.

**When we want to get a value from the map**, _HashMap_ calculates the bucket and gets the value with the same key from the list (or tree).
