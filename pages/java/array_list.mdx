# ArrayList

## Overview

In this article, we’re going to take a look at _ArrayList_ class from the Java Collections Framework. We’ll discuss its properties, common use cases, as well as its advantages and disadvantages.

_ArrayList_ resides within Java Core Libraries, so you don’t need any additional libraries. In order to use it just add the following import statement:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

_List_ represents an ordered sequence of values where some value may occur more than one time.

_ArrayList_ is one of the _List_ implementations built atop an array, which is able to dynamically grow and shrink as you add/remove elements. Elements could be easily accessed by their indexes starting from zero. This implementation has the following properties:

Random access takes _O(1)_ time
Adding element takes amortized constant time _O(1)_
Inserting/Deleting takes _O(n)_ time
Searching takes _O(n)_ time for unsorted array and _O(log n)_ for a sorted one

## Create an _ArrayList_

_ArrayList_ has several constructors and we will present them all in this section.

First, notice that _ArrayList_ is a generic class, so you can parameterize it with any type you want and the compiler will ensure that, for example, you will not be able to put _Integer_ values inside a collection of _Strings_. Also, you don’t need to cast elements when retrieving them from a collection.

Secondly, it is good practice to use generic interface _List_ as a variable type, because it decouples it from a particular implementation.

### Default No-Arg Constructor

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
assertTrue(list.isEmpty());
```

We’re simply creating an empty _ArrayList_ instance.

### Constructor Accepting Initial Capacity

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(20);
```

Here you specify the initial length of an underlying array. This may help you avoid unnecessary resizing while adding new items.

### Constructor Accepting _Collection_

```java
Collection<Integer> numbers 
  = IntStream.range(0, 10).boxed().collect(toSet());

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(numbers);
assertEquals(10, list.size());
assertTrue(numbers.containsAll(list));
```

Notice, that element of the _Collection_ instance are used for populating the underlying array.

## Add Elements to the _ArrayList_

You may insert an element either at the end or at the specific position:

```java
List<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();

list.add(1L);
list.add(2L);
list.add(1, 3L);

assertThat(Arrays.asList(1L, 3L, 2L), equalTo(list));
```

You may also insert a collection or several elements at once:

```java
List<Long> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L));
LongStream.range(4, 10).boxed()
  .collect(collectingAndThen(toCollection(ArrayList::new), ys -> list.addAll(0, ys)));
assertThat(Arrays.asList(4L, 5L, 6L, 7L, 8L, 9L, 1L, 2L, 3L), equalTo(list));
```

## Iterate Over the _ArrayList_

There are two types of iterators available: _Iterator_ and _ListIterator_.

While the former gives you an opportunity to traverse the list in one direction, the latter allows you to traverse it in both directions.

Here we will show you only the _ListIterator_:

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(
  IntStream.range(0, 10).boxed().collect(toCollection(ArrayList::new))
);
ListIterator<Integer> it = list.listIterator(list.size());
List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(list.size());
while (it.hasPrevious()) {
    result.add(it.previous());
}

Collections.reverse(list);
assertThat(result, equalTo(list));
```

You may also search, add or remove elements using iterators.

## Search the _ArrayList_

We will demonstrate how searching works using a collection:

```java
List<String> list = LongStream.range(0, 16)
  .boxed()
  .map(Long::toHexString)
  .collect(toCollection(ArrayList::new));
List<String> stringsToSearch = new ArrayList<>(list);
stringsToSearch.addAll(list);
```

### Searching an Unsorted List

In order to find an element you may use _indexOf()_ or _lastIndexOf()_ methods. They both accept an object and return _int_ value:

```java
assertEquals(10, stringsToSearch.indexOf("a"));
assertEquals(26, stringsToSearch.lastIndexOf("a"));
```

If you want to find all elements satisfying a predicate, you may filter collection using Java 8 _Stream API_ using _Predicate_ like this:

```java
Set<String> matchingStrings = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "c", "9"));

List<String> result = stringsToSearch
  .stream()
  .filter(matchingStrings::contains)
  .collect(toCollection(ArrayList::new));

assertEquals(6, result.size());
```

It is also possible to use a _for_ loop or an iterator:

```java
Iterator<String> it = stringsToSearch.iterator();
Set<String> matchingStrings = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "c", "9"));

List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    String s = it.next();
    if (matchingStrings.contains(s)) {
        result.add(s);
    }
}
```

### Searching a Sorted List

If you have a sorted array, then you may use a binary search algorithm which works faster than linear search:

```java
List<String> copy = new ArrayList<>(stringsToSearch);
Collections.sort(copy);
int index = Collections.binarySearch(copy, "f");
assertThat(index, not(equalTo(-1)));
```

Notice that if an element is not found then -1 will be returned.

## Remove Elements from the _ArrayList_

In order to remove an element, you should find its index and only then perform the removal via _remove()_ method. An overloaded version of this method, that accepts an object, searches for it and performs removal of the first occurrence of an equal element:

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(
  IntStream.range(0, 10).boxed().collect(toCollection(ArrayList::new))
);
Collections.reverse(list);

list.remove(0);
assertThat(list.get(0), equalTo(8));

list.remove(Integer.valueOf(0));
assertFalse(list.contains(0));
```

But be careful when working with boxed types such as _Integer_. In order to remove a particular element, you should first box _int_ value or otherwise, an element will be removed by its index.

You may as well use the aforementioned _Stream API_ for removing several items, but we won’t show it here. For this purpose we will use an iterator:

```java
Set<String> matchingStrings
 = HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"));

Iterator<String> it = stringsToSearch.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    if (matchingStrings.contains(it.next())) {
        it.remove();
    }
}
```
