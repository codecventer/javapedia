# Static Keyword

## Overview

In this tutorial, we’ll explore the _static_ keyword of the Java language in detail.

We’ll find out how we can apply the _static_ keyword to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes, and what difference it makes.

## The Anatomy of the _static_ Keyword

In the Java programming language, **the keyword _static_ means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type**.

This means we’ll create only one instance of that static member that’s shared across all instances of the class.

We can apply the keyword to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.

## The _static_ Fields (Or Class Variables)

In Java, **when we declare a field _static_, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class**.

It doesn’t matter how many times we instantiate a class. There will always be only one copy of _static_ field belonging to it. The value of this _static_ field is shared across all objects of either the same class.

From the memory perspective, **static variables are stored in the heap memory**.

### Example of the _static_ Field

Let’s say we have a _Car_ class with several attributes (instance variables).

Whenever we instantiate new objects from this _Car_ blueprint, each new object will have its distinct copy of these instance variables.

However, suppose we want a variable that holds the count of the number of instantiated _Car_ objects and is shared across all instances so they can access it and increment it upon their initialization.

That’s where _static_ variables come in:

```java
public class Car {
    private String name;
    private String engine;
    
    public static int numberOfCars;
    
    public Car(String name, String engine) {
        this.name = name;
        this.engine = engine;
        numberOfCars++;
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```
Now for every object of this class that we instantiate, the same copy of the _numberOfCars_ variable is incremented.

So, for this case, these will be true:

```java
@Test
public void whenNumberOfCarObjectsInitialized_thenStaticCounterIncreases() {
    new Car("Jaguar", "V8");
    new Car("Bugatti", "W16");
 
    assertEquals(2, Car.numberOfCars);
}
```

### Compelling Reasons to Use _static_ Fields

Here are some reasons for when we’d want to use _static_ fields:

- when the value of the variable is independent of objects
- when the value is supposed to be shared across all objects

### Key Points to Remember

Since _static_ variables belong to a class, we can access them directly using the class name. So, **we don’t need any object reference**.

We can only declare static variables at the class level.

We can **access _static_ fields without object initialization**.

Finally, we can access static fields using an object reference (such as _ford.numberOfCars++_). But we should avoid this because it becomes difficult to figure out if it’s an instance variable or a class variable. Instead, **we should always refer to _static_ variables using the class name (_Car.numberOfCars++_)**.

## The _static_ Methods (Or Class Methods)

Similar to _static_ fields, static methods also belong to a class instead of an object. So, we can call them without creating the object of the class in which they reside.

### Example of _static_ Method

We generally use _static_ methods to perform an operation that’s not dependent upon instance creation.

In order to share code across all instances of that class, we write it in a _static_ method:

```java
static void setNumberOfCars(int numberOfCars) {
    Car.numberOfCars = numberOfCars;
}
```

We also commonly use _static_ methods to create utility or helper classes so that we can get them without creating a new object of these classes.

As examples, we can take a look at _Collections_ or _Math_ utility classes from JDK, _StringUtils_ from Apache, or _CollectionUtils_ from Spring framework and notice that all their utility methods are _static_.

### Compelling Reasons to Use _static_ Methods

Let’s look at a few reasons why we’d want to use _static_ methods:

- to access/manipulate static variables and other static methods that don’t depend upon objects.
- _static_ methods are widely used in utility and helper classes.

### Key Points to Remember

_static_ methods in Java are resolved at compile time. Since method overriding is part of Runtime Polymorphism, **_static_ methods can’t be overridden**.

**Abstract methods can’t be static**.

_static_ methods **can’t use _this_ or _super_ keywords**.

The following combinations of the instance, class methods, and variables are valid:

1. instance methods can directly access both instance methods and instance variables
2. instance methods can also access _static_ variables and _static_ methods directly
3. _static_ methods can access all _static_ variables and other _static_ methods
4. **_static_ methods can’t access instance variables and instance methods directly**. They need some object reference to do so.

### Calling Non-static Method in Static Method in Java

In order to call a non-static method in a static method, we must use an instance of the class containing the non-static method. **This is a common use case when calling a non-static method in the _main()_ static method for example**.

Let’s consider an example of the _Car_ class that we introduced earlier in this article, and which defines the following methods:

```java
public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public String getEngine() {
    return engine;
}

public static String getCarsInformation(Car car) {
    return car.getName() + "-" + car.getEngine();
}
```

As we can see, we are calling _getName()_ and _getEngine()_ methods, which are non-static methods, in the _getCarsInformation()_ static method. This is only possible because we use an instance of the _Car_ object to access these methods. Otherwise, we’d get this error message “_Non-static method ‘getName()’ cannot be referenced from a static context_“.

## A _static_ Block

We use a _static_ block to initialize _static_ variables. Although we can initialize _static_ variables directly during declaration, there are situations when we need to do multiline processing. In such cases, _static_ blocks come in handy.

**If _static_ variables require additional, multi-statement logic during initialization, we can use a _static_ block**.

### The _static_ Block Example

For instance, let’s suppose we want to initialize a _List_ object with some predefined values.

This becomes easy with _static_ blocks:

```java
public class StaticBlockDemo {
    public static List<String> ranks = new LinkedList<>();

    static {
        ranks.add("Lieutenant");
        ranks.add("Captain");
        ranks.add("Major");
    }
    
    static {
        ranks.add("Colonel");
        ranks.add("General");
    }
}
```

It wouldn’t be possible to initialize a _List_ object with all the initial values along with declaration. So, this is why we’ve utilized the _static_ block here.

### Compelling Reasons to Use _static_ Blocks

Below are a few reasons for for using _static_ blocks:

- if the initialization of _static_ variables needs some additional logic apart from the assignment
- if the initialization of _static_ variables is error-prone and needs exception handling

### Key Points to Remember

A **class can have multiple _static_ blocks**.

_static_ fields and _static_ blocks are resolved and run in the same order as they are present in the class.

## A _static_ Class

Java allows us to create a class within a class. It provides a way of grouping elements that we’ll only use in one place. This helps to keep our code more organized and readable.

In general, the nested class architecture is divided into two types:

- nested classes that we declare _static_ are called **_static_ nested classes
- nested classes that are non-_static_ are called **inner classes**

The main difference between these two is that the inner classes have access to all members of the enclosing class (including _private_ ones), whereas the _static_ nested classes only have access to static members of the outer class.

In fact, **_static_ nested classes behave exactly like any other top-level class, but are enclosed in the only class that will access it, to provide better packaging convenience**.

### Example of _static_ Class

The most widely used approach to create singleton objects is through a _static_ nested class:

```java
public class Singleton  {
    private Singleton() {}

    private static class SingletonHolder {
        public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.instance;
    }
}
```

We use this method because it doesn’t require any synchronization and is easy to learn and implement.

Another nested static class example, where visibility between parent and nested members is displayed, and vice versa:

```java
public class Pizza {

    private static String cookedCount;
    private boolean isThinCrust;

    public static class PizzaSalesCounter {

        private static String orderedCount;
        public static String deliveredCount;

        PizzaSalesCounter() {
            System.out.println("Static field of enclosing class is "
              + Pizza.cookedCount);
            System.out.println("Non-static field of enclosing class is "
              + new Pizza().isThinCrust);
        }
    }

    Pizza() {
        System.out.println("Non private static field of static class is "
          + PizzaSalesCounter.deliveredCount);
        System.out.println("Private static field of static class is "
          + PizzaSalesCounter.orderedCount);
    }

    public static void main(String[] a) {
           new Pizza.PizzaSalesCounter();
    }
}
```

The result when we run the main method is:

```
Static field of enclosing class is null
Non private static field of static class is null
Private static field of static class is null
Non-static field of enclosing class is false
```

### Compelling Reasons to Use a _static_ Inner Class

Let’s take a look at a few reasons for using _static_ inner classes in our code:

- grouping classes that will be used only in one place increases encapsulation
- we bring the code closer to the only place that will use it. This increases readability, and the code is more maintainable.
- if a nested class doesn’t require any access to its enclosing class instance members, it’s better to declare it as _static_. This way, it won’t be coupled to the outer class and is therefore more optimal, as they won’t require any heap or stack memory.

### Key Points to Remember

**Basically, a _static_ nested class doesn’t have access to any instance members of the enclosing outer class**. It can only access them through an object’s reference.

_static_ nested classes can access all static members of the enclosing class, including private ones.

**Java programming specification doesn’t allow us to declare the top-level class as _static_**. Only classes within the classes (nested classes) can be made as _static_.

## Understanding the Error “_Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context_”

Typically, this error occurs when we use a non-static variable inside a static context.

As we saw earlier, static variables belong to the class and are loaded at class load time. On the other hand, we need to create an object in order to refer to non-static variables.

So, **the Java compiler complains because there’s a need for an object to call or use non-static variables**.

Now that we know what causes the error, let’s illustrate it using an example:

```java
public class MyClass { 
    int instanceVariable = 0; 
    
    public static void staticMethod() { 
        System.out.println(instanceVariable); 
    } 
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass.staticMethod();
    }
}
```

As we can see, we used _instanceVariable_, which is a non-static variable, inside the static method _staticMethod_.

As a result, we will get the error _Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context_.
