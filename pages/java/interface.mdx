# Interfaces

## What Are Interfaces in Java?

In Java, an interface is an abstract type that contains a collection of methods and constant variables. It is one of the core concepts in Java and is **used to achieve abstraction, polymorphism and multiple inheritances**.

Let’s see a simple example of an interface in Java:

```java
public interface Electronic {

    // Constant variable
    String LED = "LED";

    // Abstract method
    int getElectricityUse();

    // Static method
    static boolean isEnergyEfficient(String electtronicType) {
        if (electtronicType.equals(LED)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    //Default method
    default void printDescription() {
        System.out.println("Electronic Description");
    }
}
```

We can implement an interface in a Java class by using the _implements_ keyword.

Next, let’s also create a _Computer_ class that implements the _Electronic_ interface we just created:

```java
public class Computer implements Electronic {

    @Override
    public int getElectricityUse() {
        return 1000;
    }
}
```

### Rules for Creating Interfaces

In an interface, we’re allowed to use:

constants variables
abstract methods
static methods
default methods
We also should remember that:

we can’t instantiate interfaces directly
an interface can be empty, with no methods or variables in it
we can’t use the _final_ word in the interface definition, as it will result in a compiler error
all interface declarations should have the _public_ or default access modifier; the _abstract_ modifier will be added automatically by the compiler
an interface method can’t be _protected_ or _final_
up until Java 9, interface methods could not be _private_; however, Java 9 introduced the possibility to define private methods in interfaces
interface variables are _public_, _static_, and _final_ by definition; we’re not allowed to change their visibility

## What Can We Achieve by Using Them?

### Behavioral Functionality

We use interfaces to add certain behavioral functionality that can be used by unrelated classes. For instance, _Comparable_, _Comparator_, and _Cloneable_ are Java interfaces that can be implemented by unrelated classes. Below is an example of the _Comparator_ interface that is used to compare two instances of the _Employee_ class:

```java
public class Employee {

    private double salary;

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

public class EmployeeSalaryComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Employee employeeA, Employee employeeB) {
        if (employeeA.getSalary() < employeeB.getSalary()) {
            return -1;
        } else if (employeeA.getSalary() > employeeB.getSalary()) { 
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple Inheritances

Java classes support singular inheritance. However, by using interfaces, we’re also able to implement multiple inheritances.

For instance, in the example below, we notice that the _Car_ class implements the _Fly_ and _Transform_ interfaces. By doing so, it inherits the methods _fly_ and _transform_:

```java
public interface Transform {
    void transform();
}

public interface Fly {
    void fly();
}

public class Car implements Fly, Transform {

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("I can Fly!!");
    }

    @Override
    public void transform() {
        System.out.println("I can Transform!!");
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism

Let’s start with asking the question: what is polymorphism? It’s the ability for an object to take different forms during runtime. To be more specific it’s the execution of the override method that is related to a specific object type at runtime.

**In Java, we can achieve polymorphism using interfaces**. For example, the _Shape_ interface can take different forms — it can be a _Circle_ or a _Square_.

Let’s start by defining the _Shape_ interface:

```java
public interface Shape {
    String name();
}
```

Now let’s also create the _Circle_ class:

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "Circle";
    }
}
```

And also the _Square_ class:

```java
public class Square implements Shape {

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "Square";
    }
}
```

Finally, it’s time to see polymorphism in action using our _Shape_ interface and its implementations. Let’s instantiate some _Shape_ objects, add them to a _List_, and, finally, print their names in a loop:

```java
List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();
Shape circleShape = new Circle();
Shape squareShape = new Square();

shapes.add(circleShape);
shapes.add(squareShape);

for (Shape shape : shapes) {
    System.out.println(shape.name());
}
```

## Default Methods in Interfaces

Traditional interfaces in Java 7 and below don’t offer backward compatibility.

What this means is that **if you have legacy code written in Java 7 or earlier, and you decide to add an abstract method to an existing interface, then all the classes that implement that interface must override the new abstract method**. Otherwise, the code will break.

**Java 8 solved this problem by introducing the default method** that is optional and can be implemented at the interface level.

## Interface Inheritance Rules

In order to achieve multiple inheritances thru interfaces, we have to remember a few rules. Let’s go over these in detail.

### Interface Extending Another Interface

When an interface _extends_ another interface, it inherits all of that interface’s abstract methods. Let’s start by creating two interfaces, _HasColor_ and _Shape_:

```java
public interface HasColor {
    String getColor();
}

public interface Box extends HasColor {
    int getHeight()
}
```

In the example above, _Box_ inherits from _HasColor_ using the keyword _extends_. By doing so, the _Box_ interface inherits _getColor_. As a result, the _Box_ interface now has two methods: _getColor_ and _getHeight_.

### Abstract Class Implementing an Interface

When an abstract class implements an interface, it inherits all of its abstract and default methods. Let’s consider the _Transform_ interface and the _abstract_ class _Vehicle_ that implements it:

```java
public interface Transform {
    
    void transform();
    default void printSpecs(){
        System.out.println("Transform Specification");
    }
}

public abstract class Vehicle implements Transform {}
```

In this example, the _Vehicle_ class inherits two methods: the abstract _transform_ method and the default _printSpecs_ method.

## Functional Interfaces

Java has had many functional interfaces since its early days, such as _Comparable_ (since Java 1.2) and _Runnable_ (since Java 1.0).

Java 8 introduced new functional interfaces such as _Predicate_, _Consumer_, and _Function_.
