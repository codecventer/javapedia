# Java EE

Java EE, or Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, is a comprehensive set of APIs and runtime environments that provide developers with the tools to build large-scale, enterprise-level applications.

Originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation), Java EE offers a robust infrastructure for developing and deploying distributed, multi-tiered, and secure applications.

It encompasses a wide range of features including servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Message Service (JMS), and many others.

Java EE's modular architecture allows developers to assemble applications using reusable components, promoting scalability, maintainability, and portability across different environments.

With its strong emphasis on standards compliance and compatibility, Java EE remains a popular choice for building mission-critical enterprise software systems.
